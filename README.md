Designed a high-frequency PLL circuit on a two-layer PCB using KiCad, optimizing signal integrity and minimizing phase noise for RF 
applications.
Implemented precise trace routing, controlled impedance, and grounding strategies to enhance frequency stability and reduce 
electromagnetic interference (EMI).
